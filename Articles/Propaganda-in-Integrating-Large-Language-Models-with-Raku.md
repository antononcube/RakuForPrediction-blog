## Introduction

This post applies the Large Language Model (LLM) summarization prompt ["FindPropagandaMessage"](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/antononcube/DeployedResources/Prompt/FindPropagandaMessage/) 
to the transcript of The Raku Conference 2023 (TRC-2023) presentation
["Integrating Large Language Models with Raku"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OxKqRrQvh0) 
hosted by the YouTube channel [The Raku Conference](https://www.youtube.com/@therakuconference6823). 

In the presentation, Anton Antonov presents "Integrating Large Language Models with Raku," demonstrating functionalities in Visual Studio Code using a
[Raku Chatbook](https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Jupyter::Chatbook).
The presentation explores using OpenAI, PaLM (Google's large language model), and DALL-E (image generation service) through Raku, showcasing dynamic interaction with large language models, embedding them in notebooks, and generating code and markdown outputs.

**Remark:** The LLM results below were obtained from the "raw" transcript, which did not have punctuation.

**Remark:** The transcription software had problems parsing the names of the participants. Some of the names were manually corrected.

**Remark:** The content of this post was generated with the computational Markdown file
["LLM-content-breakdown-template.md"](https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-blog/blob/main/Articles/LLM-content-breakdown-template.md),
which was executed (or woven) by the CLI script `file-code-chunks-eval` of
["Text::CodeProcessing"](https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Text::CodeProcessing), [AAp7].

## Hidden and propaganda messages

In this section we try to find is the text apolitical and propaganda-free.

**Remark:** We leave to reader as an exercise to verify that both the overt and hidden messages found by the LLM below are explicitly stated in the text.

**Remark:** The LLM prompt "FindPropagandaMessage" has an explicit instruction to say that it is intentionally cynical. 
It is also, marked as being "For fun."

The LLM result is rendered below.

### MESSAGES: 
 Anton Antonov wants you to believe he is demonstrating a technical integration, but he is actually advocating for a new era of programming innovation.

### PERCEPTIONS: 
 Anton Antonov wants you to believe he is a technical presenter, but he's actually a visionary for future programming landscapes.

### ELLUL'S ANALYSIS: 
 Based on Jacques Ellul's "Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes," Antonov's presentation can be seen as a form of sociotechnical propaganda, aiming to shape perceptions and attitudes towards the integration of language models with Raku, thereby heralding a new direction in programming and technological development. His methodical demonstration and the strategic presentation of use cases serve not only to inform but to convert the audience to the belief that mastering these technologies is imperative for future innovation.

### BERNAYS' ANALYSIS: 
 Drawing from Edward Bernays' "Propaganda" and "Engineering of Consent," Antonov's presentation exemplifies the engineering of consent within the tech community. By showcasing the seamless integration of Raku with language models, he subtly persuades the audience of the necessity and inevitability of embracing these technologies. His approach mirrors Bernays' theory that public opinion can be swayed through strategic, informative presentations, leading to widespread acceptance and adoption of new technological paradigms.

### LIPPMANN'S ANALYSIS: 
 Walter Lippmann's "Public Opinion" suggests that the public's perception of reality is often a constructed understanding. Antonov's presentation plays into this theory by constructing a narrative where Raku's integration with language models is presented as the next logical step in programming evolution. This narrative, built through careful demonstration and explanation, aims to shape the audience's understanding and perceptions of current technological capabilities and future potentials.

### FRANKFURT'S ANALYSIS: 
 Harry G. Frankfurt's "On Bullshit" provides a framework for understanding the distinction between lying and bullshitting. Antonov's presentation, through its detailed and factual approach, steers clear of bullshitting. Instead, it focuses on conveying genuine possibilities and advancements in the integration of Raku with language models. His candid discussion and demonstration of functionalities reflect a commitment to truth and potential, rather than a disregard for truth typical of bullshit.
