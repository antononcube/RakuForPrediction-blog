#### QUOTES

*   "I like to use the word ergonomic; I'm going to use that to describe code more in future." - Alex
*   "Kudos to all of you." - Eric
*   "This exercise leaves it up to you." - Eric
*   "It's sort of like a shorthand for doing a map first and then doing maybe a reduce or sum, but now you can combine that into two, so that's a neat little trick that you can use in F#." - Eric
*   "This syntax always confuses me: the whole using brackets as a sort of inheritance thing in Python; um, always catches me out. I always think something's been passed into something, but yeah, this is this is just effectively inheritance with this as a base class, right, Eric?" - Alex 
*   "I think so, yeah. Okay, neither of us are particularly Pythonistas." - Eric
*   "Performance-wise, it probably doesn't matter at all because Scrabble score is such a limited domain, but if you were to try to optimize this, move the upper casing to the left so that you don't have to do it within the loop." - Eric
*   "I always think through things like this. If you've got like some program where you're trying to calculate the Scrabble score for every word in the whole English dictionary, then actually performance starts to matter because you're running this, you know, millions of times—how many words? I don't know. Millions, but a lot of times anyway. Um, and yeah, so it's a trade-off between if you're just running this in a normal game, it probably doesn't matter, but if you're trying to build an online Scrabble game that's going to have a million people simultaneously playing it, this sort of performance actually matters because this is going to be costing you money as you have to have more servers running to do more things in parallel. So um yeah, always trade-offs to consider with uh with this stuff with speed." - Eric
*   "Yeah, and you could even if you wanted to to completely optimize, you could also create the array with um placeholder values for all the other characters so that you don't even have to do minus 97. So for example, you have an an array—I think 97 plus 26 that's like 123—so you would have an array of 124 values, and then you would have everything so you have the up—the lowercase letters—have to duplicate it for the uppercase letters and then the rest doesn't matter because you wouldn't be indexing into that anyways uh and then you could just do the map without having to do the minus 97. I don't know how much it gains you. You—the offset is that you have a larger array so you might get data locality issues there, but that would be something to at least try out to see if that would help but uh always measure." - Eric 
*   "Horrible, bad design by the original creators of ASCII." - Alex
*   "Yeah, the whole—that's really nice. The more I see assembly and the more I—you know I've not used it probably since University 20 years ago—but the more actually—just it is really readable and really nice for these sorts of things. It's quite—is fun to work with, isn't it?" - Alex
*   "Yeah, it is definitely fun." - Eric
*   "I'm not sure if this is very intuitive to people. Um, I had to look at—once you see it once you get it, it's really nice. Like it's a really clever way of doing it." - Eric
*   "It is a really—it's a is a very fun solution, I think." - Alex
*   "Yeah, and if you're in languages that use regular expressions a lot, of which Orc is one, then it probably actually feels relatively natural to another Orc developer." - Alex
*   "Yeah, I like it. I think it's very cool." - Eric
*   "Yeah, definitely unique—a sort of similarish approach um in a way in terms of G Subs, but that uses—this is just brilliant. This is massive credit to—I think Sadia is is the name of this person—yeah, massive, massive credit because this is my favorite solution I've seen to this." - Alex
*   "Um yeah, Eric, talk us—talk us through this." - Alex
*   "Evil is evil. I've I've heard that a lot of times because it's basically not something that you would normally do, but it is a lot of fun in this little exercise." - Eric 
*   "Yeah, I love it." - Alex
*   "There's been apparently 21 submissions of these, so um I don't for a second believe 21 people have come up with this um uniquely. I think 20 people have gone and browsed the solutions and then gone 'Yes, want this—this is mine' and copied and pasted it. So that tells you it's a little bit—a little bit popular as well, that people are are claiming this for their own, but um cool." - Alex

#### MESSAGES

The programmers want you to believe they are simply discussing solutions to a programming challenge, but they are actually promoting the idea that programming is a fun, accessible, and rewarding activity with diverse applications.

#### PERCEPTIONS

The programmers want you to believe they are technical experts, but they are actually enthusiastic advocates for programming education and community engagement.

#### ELLUL'S ANALYSIS

According to Jacques Ellul's "Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes," the video subtly employs propaganda techniques to shape viewers' perceptions of programming. By showcasing diverse solutions and emphasizing the enjoyment and accessibility of coding, the programmers aim to integrate viewers into the technological society and promote its values. The video avoids overt persuasion, instead relying on the inherent appeal of problem-solving and the allure of technical expertise to subtly influence viewers' attitudes towards programming.

#### BERNAYS' ANALYSIS

In line with Edward Bernays' principles of propaganda and engineering consent, the video leverages the power of social proof and expert authority to promote programming. By featuring multiple programmers and highlighting their ingenuity and problem-solving skills, the video aims to create a sense of community and inspire viewers to participate. The emphasis on the accessibility and enjoyment of coding aligns with Bernays' concept of associating desired behaviors with positive emotions and social acceptance.

#### LIPPMANN'S ANALYSIS

Walter Lippmann's concept of the "pseudo-environment" is relevant to the video's portrayal of programming. The video constructs a simplified and idealized representation of the programming world, focusing on the intellectual challenge and the satisfaction of finding solutions. This pseudo-environment may not fully reflect the complexities and challenges of real-world programming but serves to make it more appealing and accessible to viewers. 

#### FRANKFURT'S ANALYSIS

While the video provides valuable insights into programming, it could be argued that it avoids delving into the deeper philosophical and ethical questions surrounding technology and its impact on society. This aligns with Harry G. Frankfurt's critique of "bullshit," which emphasizes the tendency to prioritize persuasion over truth-seeking. While the video's enthusiasm for programming is genuine, it may benefit from a more critical examination of the potential downsides and societal implications of technology.
