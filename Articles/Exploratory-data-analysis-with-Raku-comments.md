## EDN comment by *raiph*


As I think you know, what you've been doing caught my attention a few years ago and has remained compelling since then.

However, I've never found the "raku for prediction" or "computational conversational agents" labels resonated for me. I ignored that because it seemed more interesting to focus on what you were actually doing rather than being distracted by the labels you were applying to the broader field you are working within.

Today I decided it would be helpful to come up with my own label for what I see, a label that is deliberately as narrow as makes sense to me to encompass the last couple years worth of your blog posts. I googled for a few minutes and something quickly crystalized: EDNs, Exploratory Data Notebooks.

Are you aware of the EDN term/market? If you are -- or even if you're not but are willing to spend a few minutes getting up to speed on the field by browsing a suitable google search -- I'd love to hear your thoughts about some questions:

- Would you agree that AI features/data are a natural drop-in addition for EDNs, so don't alter the appropriateness of EDNs?

- Do you feel EDNs would be a good label for most if not all of the Raku blog posts you've published in the last couple years? If you think EDNs mostly captures what you've been publishing, yet misses key elements, what are those elements? If EDNs so seriously misses the mark you think it would be a poor label, why do you feel that way?

- Are you aware of ExplainED and can you imagine it being another useful piece of the puzzle?

- Can you imagine EDNs using the same techniques you've been using that explore the EDN field (the tech) and/or market?
