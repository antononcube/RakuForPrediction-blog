## [EDN comment by *raiph*](https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/1d079vg/comment/l5nh36j)


As I think you know, what you've been doing caught my attention a few years ago and has remained compelling since then.

However, I've never found the "raku for prediction" or "computational conversational agents" labels resonated for me. I ignored that because it seemed more interesting to focus on what you were actually doing rather than being distracted by the labels you were applying to the broader field you are working within.

Today I decided it would be helpful to come up with my own label for what I see, a label that is deliberately as narrow as makes sense to me to encompass the last couple years worth of your blog posts. I googled for a few minutes and something quickly crystalized: EDNs, Exploratory Data Notebooks.

Are you aware of the EDN term/market? If you are -- or even if you're not but are willing to spend a few minutes getting up to speed on the field by browsing a suitable google search -- I'd love to hear your thoughts about some questions:

- Would you agree that AI features/data are a natural drop-in addition for EDNs, so don't alter the appropriateness of EDNs?

- Do you feel EDNs would be a good label for most if not all of the Raku blog posts you've published in the last couple years? If you think EDNs mostly captures what you've been publishing, yet misses key elements, what are those elements? If EDNs so seriously misses the mark you think it would be a poor label, why do you feel that way?

- Are you aware of ExplainED and can you imagine it being another useful piece of the puzzle?

- Can you imagine EDNs using the same techniques you've been using that explore the EDN field (the tech) and/or market?

## Answer to *raiph*

### Sure, it is just EDN

Exploratory Data Notebooks (EDN) is a fairly valid -- and narrow -- way of characterizing what I am doing in Raku's Ecosystem (RE).

About the validity:

- My [latest video](https://youtu.be/YCnjMVSfT8w) showcases my data wrangling, data summarization, graphics work RE exactly as an EDN effort.

- The script ["raku-data-science-install.sh"](https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-book/blob/main/scripts/raku-data-science-install.sh)
shows that:
  - 60%+ of the packages I have published in Raku's Ecosystem are about Data Science
  - ≈ 30% are about Data Wrangling (hence EDN)
 
Why do I think EDN is too narrow:

- My notebook-centric work is not needed for EDN
  - It is first and foremost about using Large Language Models (LLMs) with ease
  - Brian Duggan's "Jupyter::Kernel" is fairly sufficient for EDN

### Meta language

I started Raku for Prediction (R4P) in order to simplify Machine Learning (ML) teachings and explanations.
Turned 

*TBF...*

### The narrowing instinct

I understand the "narrowing instinct" to compact, communicate, or understand efforts like mine into 
a narrower scope, like, exploratory data analysis, or some other single paradigm point of view.

This happens consistently for Mathematica and, more generally, for the efforts of Wolfram Research, Inc. (WRI).
Stephen Wolfram and WRI are often asked questions like:

> Why don't you make Mathematica more Data Science friendly?

and similar.

Simply (and cynically) put, Mathematica is made for brilliant physicists, not for people who try to sell their skills in
USA's IT job market. Physicists tend to have a very wide and diverse mathematical education, and for them mathematics 
and computer science are "just tools." Most IT professionals want to feel or sell themselves as experts -- 
that is not a scientific pre-disposition.

So, similarly, with R4P (damn I hate that acronym now!) I try to address a wide scope of computational workflows 
that include not just Data Science and Machine Learning, but also Scientific Computing and Mathematical Modeling.

At this point Raku can be only (barely) used to *do* Data Science and Machine Learning. Most Raku users / developers / practitioners
are not interested in doing Science and Mathematical Modeling with Raku. Hence, the inclination to see efforts like R4P
as data-centric in one way or the other -- data manipulation and wrangling is universally understood.
