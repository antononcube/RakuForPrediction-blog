## Most important or provocative statements

Here is a table of the most important or provocative statements in the text:


<table border="1"><thead><tr><th>subject</th><th>statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Focus on the Future</td><td>I&#39;m simply so focused on what&#39;s coming next that I&#39;m more or less just comfortably indifferent to what&#39;s gone before.</td></tr><tr><td>Contribution Statistics</td><td>In the past quarter Century I&#39;ve written about 3.8 million lines of Open Source Pearl and Raku and uploaded something to the cpan about once every 3 weeks in the form of 81 separate modules.</td></tr><tr><td>Travel and Speaking</td><td>In the same time I&#39;ve given over 300 presentations on average about one every month for a total of just in excess of a thousand hours of speaking and I gave those presentations in 66 cities in 22 countries across four continents.</td></tr><tr><td>Community Support</td><td>All of that work all of that development all of that travel all of that speaking was made possible by people just like you the international Pearl community.</td></tr><tr><td>Lorentz Contraction</td><td>When you do a large amount of traveling you&#39;re also doing a very small amount of time traveling because of Lorent contraction.</td></tr><tr><td>AI in Programming</td><td>So it turns out that the last 25 years of advanced programming that I&#39;ve been trying to do can now effectively be completely replaced by glorified autocomplete.</td></tr><tr><td>AI Debugging</td><td>It turns out that large language models can in buug code now at near human levels of performance.</td></tr><tr><td>Future of Coding Jobs</td><td>My next job probably won&#39;t be writing code to solve someone&#39;s problem but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be telling an AI to write code to solve the problem either.</td></tr><tr><td>Module Creation</td><td>Whenever I see something like this where I&#39;m doing the same thing over and over and over again then I immediately jump in the DeLorean go back to 2 15 when I released keyword declare.</td></tr><tr><td>Source Code Filters</td><td>A source code filter that understands Pearl syntax I think that&#39;s actually worthy of exclamation marks rather than question marks.</td></tr><tr><td>Multiple Dispatch</td><td>Multiple dispatch is the ability to declare two or more versions of the same named method which have different signatures and then you select based on the number of arguments that are actually passed.</td></tr><tr><td>Module: multi-dispatch</td><td>The module is called multi- dispatch it&#39;s on the cpan now.</td></tr><tr><td>Switch and Smart Match</td><td>Switch and smart match are going away next year for very good reasons and those very good reasons are simply this enormous table these 23 rules that no sane person can actually remember.</td></tr><tr><td>Module: switch-back</td><td>The switch module is back baby and the module is going to be called switch back.</td></tr><tr><td>Improvement of Smart Matching</td><td>What if smart matching hadn&#39;t required 46 rules to work what if it had required maybe just six rules maybe it wouldn&#39;t have to die.</td></tr><tr><td>Module: switch-right</td><td>It&#39;s called switch right it&#39;s on the cpan now.</td></tr><tr><td>Gratitude</td><td>I am profoundly grateful to every one of you for your friendship for your encouragement and for the very practical kinds of support that you&#39;ve given me that made that possible.</td></tr><tr><td>Final Statement</td><td>So now after 25 years the only thing I have left to say is the thing that I always say from the bottom of my heart thank you.</td></tr></tbody></table>
