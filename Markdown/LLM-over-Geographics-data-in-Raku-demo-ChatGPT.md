My name is Anton Antonov today&#39;s June 16, 2024.</td></tr><tr><td>Packages</td><td>This presentation is mostly about this to Raku packages &#39;Data::Geographics&#39; and &#39;JavaScript::Google::Charts&#39;.</td></tr><tr><td>Plotting</td><td>You can see here in the plot some the data from the first has been used and I have invoke the function from the second package to make this geographical plot.</td></tr><tr><td>Panels</td><td>The left panel is with a map, the middle is the presentation itself, and the rightmost part is a browser with which I&#39;m going to show some relevant data.</td></tr><tr><td>Geographics Package</td><td>The geographics package is the protagonist of this presentation. It has country data and city data visualization.</td></tr><tr><td>Programming</td><td>Initially I wrote this presentation with JavaScript D3, but it was difficult for me to make a geographical plot with it.</td></tr><tr><td>Google Charts</td><td>Google chart is relatively alter framework for making pre-can Types of charts.</td></tr><tr><td>JavaScript</td><td>JavaScript is another JavaScript for graphics but it&#39;s lower level and it&#39;s much more flexible.</td></tr><tr><td>Name Recognition</td><td>We can do name interior recognition with it and see if you make conversational agents and you want to recognize some recognize city names or country names you can use this package.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Size</td><td>Geography is a little bit too big. I&#39;m going to explain that and I need to figure out how to make it smaller.</td></tr><tr><td>Country Data</td><td>We&#39;re going to see country data, some kind of rudimentary analysis with sailing regression over the gross domestic product and electricity production.</td></tr><tr><td>City Data</td><td>The package &#39;Data::Geographics&#39; also has cities data and I&#39;m going to be showing some related statistics.</td></tr><tr><td>DSL English</td><td>I&#39;m also going to use this package DSL English data query workflows, which allows for generation of code.</td></tr><tr><td>Neighbors Graphs</td><td>With the city data we&#39;re going to do some neighbors graphs. We&#39;re going to do some proximity search and I&#39;m going to be using another new package called math nearest.</td></tr><tr><td>Google Charts Documentation</td><td>Google charts is well-documented and makes it very good for large language models.</td></tr><tr><td>Plot Customization</td><td>How exactly do you tune those colors right so figuring out is it background is it just background color right so it&#39;s like for example, the data less regions which gray right so these are the ones which the package doesn&#39;t know about.</td></tr><tr><td>Raku and Google Charts</td><td>Raku though is just a conduit so to speak to Google charts, I&#39;m not trying to put my own options.</td></tr><tr><td>Geographical Data</td><td>This data here I&#39;m going to use some this to last column and make a correlation plot.</td></tr><tr><td>Linear Regression</td><td>Let&#39;s use that as a motivation to make our own fitting so here I&#39;m using this new package math fitting, which can do at this point it can do linear regression only into dimensions.</td></tr><tr><td>Combination Chart</td><td>This is what you see. We are basically plotting the fit and we have this kind of nice nice kind of looking fit.</td></tr><tr><td>Contour Plot</td><td>What you see here it&#39;s basically to us right contour, which is a contour plot is being made for the coordinates of the boundary of a certain country United States.</td></tr><tr><td>City Data</td><td>City data it&#39;s not that populated with different types of data points it has locations populations actually has also links and this is something fun too to show.</td></tr><tr><td>City Visualization</td><td>The location link is kind of nice because we can visualize it with Google right so we can if I click on this location links I can go to the browser and see where this is.</td></tr><tr><td>Population Distribution</td><td>We&#39;re going to look into the distributions of form or across the states of population and number of cities.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Aggregation</td><td>I need to do something like this right I&#39;m basically taking the city. I am grouping by states and I am finding the number of the cities in each state and the sum the population.</td></tr><tr><td>Logarithmic Plot</td><td>If I log out of the populations then we start to have something cool something like I mean it&#39;s not exactly linear, but it is somewhat over rectangular shapes so it is a linear dependence.</td></tr><tr><td>Proximity Searches</td><td>We&#39;re going to move to actually doing proximity searches and using this new package nearest.</td></tr><tr><td>Nearest Neighbors</td><td>I&#39;m finding the actual neighbors within hundred kilometers so the distance function this one here by default uses meters distance is a function which comes from &#39;Data::Geographics&#39;.</td></tr><tr><td>Name Recognition</td><td>The function is provided by DSL entity geographics and ETS has some nice properties.</td></tr><tr><td>Graphs</td><td>This is very very interesting application of course to the nearest functionalist in my nearest.</td></tr><tr><td>Mermaid Graphs</td><td>I&#39;m calling the function neighbor and I&#39;m asking the format to be given into mermaids.</td></tr><tr><td>Graph Plot</td><td>This is graph plot, visual plot type of visualization this graph plot is in right so it comes with the I don&#39;t need to go to an external service for it.</td></tr><tr><td>Distance Function</td><td>I can say what I want the distance function to be within miles.</td></tr><tr><td>Future Plans</td><td>I do have some future plans for this quite a lot of this needs to be upgraded in someway.</td></tr><tr><td>Google Charts Limitations</td><td>Some of the things I can do here which are more specialized and they don&#39;t necessarily come from the fridge right but I have done it so I&#39;m going to demonstrate this kind of one of my favorite things examples so to be honest so actually it&#39;s not plopped.</td></tr><tr><td>Summary</td><td>We can make informative plots over this geographic data using both of this packages group free and just group chat.</td></tr></tbody></table>
