## Summary, ideas, and recommendations


#### SUMMARY

Anton Antonov presents a demo of the Raku packages "Data::Geographics" and "JavaScript::Google::Charts", showcasing their capabilities in visualizing and analyzing geographical data, including country statistics, city distributions, and nearest neighbor graphs.

#### IDEAS:

- Geographic data visualization is crucial in data science.
- Raku package "Data::Geographics" provides country and city data.
- JavaScript::Google::Charts offers a simpler approach to geographic plotting than D3.js.
- Google Charts is a well-documented and mature framework, making it suitable for large language models.
- Large language models can assist in generating Raku code for Google Charts visualizations.
- Raku's "Data::Geographics" package is currently large (30MB) and requires optimization for size and shareability.
- The presentation uses camel case for data attributes, aligning with Google Charts conventions.
- Logarithmic scales can enhance the visualization of data with large disparities.
- The "Math::Fitting" package enables linear regression analysis on geographical data.
- Residual analysis helps assess the goodness of fit for regression models.
- City data analysis reveals interesting insights into population distributions and the Pareto principle.
- The Pareto principle (80/20 rule) can be observed in the distribution of cities and population across states.
- The "DSL::Entity::Geographics" package provides named entity recognition for geographical entities.
- Nearest neighbor searches can be performed efficiently using the "Math::Nearest" package.
- Geographic distance calculations can be performed using either meters or miles.
- Visualizing nearest neighbor graphs helps understand spatial relationships between cities.
- Mermaid.js provides a formalism for specifying graphs and diagrams.
- D3.js offers alternative visualization options, such as force-directed graphs.
- Google Charts requires an API key for advanced features like Google Maps integration.
- Raku enables the creation of custom visualizations, such as random mandalas, that may not be readily available in pre-built charting libraries.

#### QUOTES:

- "Visualization in Geographics and in data science in particular is very important."
- "Google Charts is a relatively old framework for making pre-canned types of charts."
- "Large language models should be extensively trained in a sense with discussions or documents or whatever right about Google charts."
- "The package DSL entity Geographics is um going to be demonstrated very briefly actually we can do named entity recognition with it"
- "This means that um the population it has some exponential dependency when it comes to the number of cities and makes sense"
- "I mean the 80/20 rule is actually in a different manner displayed here so this is more this is like yeah like 40% 40% of the states have 80% of the populations"
- "I do have some future plans for this quite a lot of this probably needs to be needs to be upgraded in some way"

#### HABITS:

- Utilizes mind maps for presentation structure and summarization.
- Employs camel case for data attributes.
- Leverages logarithmic scales for improved data visualization.
- Performs residual analysis to evaluate regression model fit.
- Uses a consistent coding style and comments for clarity.

#### FACTS:

- Google Charts is at least 10 years old.
- The "Data::Geographics" package contains data for 29 countries.
- Each country in the dataset has approximately 200 metadata points.
- The Raku and Perl conference was scheduled to take place in Las Vegas.
- The dataset contains data for 33,000 cities in the United States.

- Raku package: "Data::Geographics"
- Raku package: "JavaScript::Google::Charts"
- JavaScript library: D3.js
- JavaScript library: Google Charts
- Raku package: "DSL::Entity::Geographics"

    <tr>
      <td>Black ⚫</td>
      <td>Judgement and Caution</td>
      <td>The presentation heavily relies on external libraries and frameworks, particularly Google Charts and D3.js. This dependency could pose challenges in terms of long-term maintainability and potential compatibility issues in the future. Additionally, the reliance on external web services for certain visualizations, like Mermaid.ink for graphs, introduces a dependency on internet connectivity and potential service disruptions. The presenter acknowledges the large size of the "Data::Geographics" package and the need for optimization, which remains an unresolved issue. The lack of a dedicated "state" entity in the data structure might limit certain types of analysis.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Gray 👹</td>
      <td>Cynicism and Skepticism</td>
      <td>Oh, another package that claims to make data visualization "easy". Let's see how long it takes before you're drowning in obscure Google Charts API options. And don't even get me started on the "rudimentary" statistical analysis. It's cute that you're fitting lines through data points, but let's not kid ourselves – this is barely scratching the surface. The whole "Raku for geographic data" pitch feels a bit niche. Is there really a demand for this, or are we just trying to find a use case for a language that's struggling to find its place? </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Red ❤️</td>
      <td>Feelings and Emotion</td>
      <td>The enthusiasm for Raku and its potential for geographic data visualization is contagious! The presenter's passion for the subject shines through, making the presentation engaging despite its technical nature. The use of real-world examples, like analyzing city data in the context of the Raku conference in Las Vegas, adds a personal touch and makes the information more relatable. </td>
