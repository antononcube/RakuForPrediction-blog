       "The provided Raku code demonstrates a simple implementation of a Dependency Injection (DI) container. Let's break down the key components and concepts:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Code Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Container Class**: This class is responsible for managing dependencies and their creation.\n",
       "   - **Attributes**:\n",
       "     - `%!bindings`: A hash to store factory methods for creating instances of classes.\n",
       "   - **Methods**:\n",
       "     - `set(Str $abstract, Callable $factory)`: Registers a factory method for a given abstract type.\n",
       "     - `get($abstract)`: Retrieves an instance of the requested type, resolving its dependencies recursively.\n",
       "     - `build-dependencies($abstract)`: Determines and constructs the dependencies required by the requested type.\n",
       "     - `has-binding(Str $abstract --> Bool)`: Checks if a factory method for the given type is registered.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Logger Class**: A simple class with a `log` method to print messages.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **SessionStorage Class**: Depends on `Logger` and uses it to log messages.\n",
       "   - **Attributes**:\n",
       "     - `Logger $!logger`: A logger instance.\n",
       "   - **Methods**:\n",
       "     - `new(Logger $logger)`: Constructor that takes a `Logger` instance.\n",
       "     - `create()`: Logs a \"Session Created\" message.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **User Class**: Depends on `SessionStorage` and uses it to create sessions.\n",
       "   - **Attributes**:\n",
       "     - `SessionStorage $.session`: A session storage instance.\n",
       "   - **Methods**:\n",
       "     - `new(SessionStorage $session)`: Constructor that takes a `SessionStorage` instance.\n",
       "     - `authenticate()`: Calls the `create` method on the session storage.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Usage**:\n",
       "   - An instance of `Container` is created.\n",
       "   - An instance of `User` is retrieved from the container.\n",
       "   - The `authenticate` method is called on the `User` instance, which triggers the creation of a session and logs a message.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Programming Paradigms\n",
       "\n",
       "The code primarily belongs to the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** paradigm, as it defines classes with attributes and methods, and uses encapsulation and inheritance.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Design Pattern\n",
       "\n",
       "The code exemplifies the **Dependency Injection (DI)** design pattern, specifically the **Service Locator** variant, where a container is used to manage and inject dependencies. The `Container` class acts as a service locator that provides instances of requested types and resolves their dependencies.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Description of Dependency Injection\n",
       "\n",
       "Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), where the control of creating and managing dependencies is inverted from the class itself to an external entity (in this case, the `Container` class). This promotes loose coupling and enhances testability and maintainability by allowing dependencies to be injected rather than hard-coded within the class.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Programming Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
       "- **Design Pattern**: Dependency Injection (Service Locator variant).\n",
       "- **Purpose**: To manage and inject dependencies, promoting loose coupling and enhancing testability.\n",
       "\n",
       "By using the `Container` class, the code dynamically resolves and injects dependencies, making it more flexible and easier to maintain."

       "### Strengths\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Separation of Concerns**: The code nicely separates the concerns of dependency management from the actual business logic. The `Container` class handles dependency resolution, while the other classes (`Logger`, `SessionStorage`, and `User`) focus on their respective functionalities.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Dynamic Dependency Resolution**: The `Container` class dynamically resolves dependencies by inspecting the constructor's signature. This makes it flexible and capable of handling various dependency graphs.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Callable Factories**: The `set` method allows for registering factories, which can be useful for more complex dependency creation logic.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Potential Improvements\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Error Handling**: The code lacks error handling. For instance, if a dependency cannot be resolved, it should throw a meaningful error message. Currently, it might fail silently or throw a generic error.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Circular Dependency Detection**: The current implementation does not check for circular dependencies, which could lead to infinite loops. Adding a mechanism to detect and handle circular dependencies would make the container more robust.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Improving `has-binding` Method**: The `has-binding` method should check for the existence of a binding for the exact `$abstract` rather than its name, to avoid potential issues with type name collisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Redundant Constructor Definitions**: The `new` methods in `SessionStorage` and `User` are redundant because they only call `self.bless`. Raku's `BUILD` method or default constructor can handle this.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Type Constraints**: Adding type constraints to method signatures can improve code readability and catch errors early.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Documentation and Comments**: Adding comments and documentation would help others understand the code better.\n",
       "\n",
