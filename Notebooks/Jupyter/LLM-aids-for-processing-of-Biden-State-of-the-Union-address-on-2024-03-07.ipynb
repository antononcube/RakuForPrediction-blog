       "\n",
       "President Biden wants you to believe he is a unifier and protector of democratic values, but he's actually a strategic politician emphasizing Democratic successes and Republican failures.\n",
       "\n",
       "ELLUL'S ANALYSIS\n",
       "\n",
       "According to Jacques Ellul's \"Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes,\" Biden's address exemplifies modern political propaganda through its strategic framing of issues, historical comparisons, and appeals to democratic ideals. Ellul would likely note the address's dual function: to solidify in-group unity (among Democratic supporters) and to subtly influence the broader public's perceptions of domestic and international challenges. The speech leverages crises as opportunities for reinforcing the necessity of Democratic governance, illustrating Ellul's observation that effective propaganda exploits existing tensions to achieve political objectives.\n",
       "\n",
       "BERNAYS' ANALYSIS\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on Edward Bernays' \"Propaganda\" and \"Engineering of Consent,\" Biden's speech can be seen as an exercise in shaping public opinion towards Democratic policies and leadership. Bernays would recognize the sophisticated use of symbols (e.g., references to historical events and figures) and emotional appeals to construct a narrative that positions Democratic governance as essential for the nation's future. The speech's emphasis on bipartisan achievements and calls for legislative action also reflect Bernays' insights into the importance of creating a perception of consensus and societal progress.\n",
       "\n",
       "LIPPMANN'S ANALYSIS\n",
       "\n",
       "Walter Lippmann's \"Public Opinion\" offers a perspective on how Biden's address attempts to manufacture consent for Democratic policies by presenting a carefully curated version of reality. Lippmann would likely point out the strategic selection of facts, statistics, and stories designed to reinforce the audience's existing preconceptions and to guide them towards desired conclusions. The address's focus on bipartisan accomplishments and urgent challenges serves to create an environment where Democratic solutions appear both reasonable and necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "FRANKFURT'S ANALYSIS\n",
       "\n",
       "Harry G. Frankfurt's \"On Bullshit\" provides a lens for criticizing the speech's relationship with truth and sincerity. Frankfurt might argue that while the address purports to be an honest assessment of the nation's state, it strategically blurs the line between truth and falsehood to serve political ends. The speech's selective presentation of facts and omission of inconvenient truths could be seen as indicative of a broader political culture where the distinction between lying and misleading is increasingly irrelevant.\n",
