At first glance, this problem may seem insurmountable due to the sheer size of the number involved. However, the numbers 10,000 and 2,500 have been chosen to work nicely together in this context, allowing us to solve the problem with some clever mathematical insights.\n",

Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, we need to count how many times 5 divides into $10,000!$, as multiples of 5 are less frequent than multiples of 2.\n",
